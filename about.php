                    <h3>about</h3>
                    <h4>Credentials</h4>
                    <p>I am a Registered Psychotherapist with the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO) and a Registered Marriage and Family Therapist with the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). I hold a Masters degree in Counselling from Tyndale University College and Seminary and an honours degree in Psychology from the University of&nbsp;Guelph.</p>
                    <h4>Counselling Approach</h4>
                    <p class="last-p">I believe in a holistic approach to counselling that focuses on the emotional, physical, cognitive, relational, and spiritual well-being of my clients. I completed my training in Family Systems Theory, which considers each person as part of a broader past and present social context. Building on this foundation, I integrate many different theories and models into my counselling, drawing primarily on Emotion Focused Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and Focusing. Each of these models helps clients leave behind unhelpful patterns and move toward authentic and healthy relationships with themselves and others.</p>
                    <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
                    <h4>Anxiety</h4>
                    <p>I help clients identify and manage the effects of anxiety, including phobias, perfectionism, and social anxiety</p>
                    <h4>Sexuality</h4>
                    <p>I believe strongly in the importance of assisting clients as they:</p>
                    <ul class="about_ul">
                        <li><em>Develop a healthy understanding of sex and sexuality</em></li>
                        <li><em>Form and maintain healthy sexual relationships</em></li>
                        <li><em>Deal with past sexual abuse</em></li>
                        <li><em>Explore gender identity</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Relationship enrichment</h4>
                    <p>For couples wanting to move toward loving and satisfying relationships, I support them every step of the&nbsp;way.</p>
